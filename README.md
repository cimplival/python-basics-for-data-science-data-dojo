# Python Basics for Data Science Project

ShippingtoMali, a shipping company, provides shipping to Mali for items bought on Amazon at a rate of `$4` for the first item and `$2` for each subsequent item with each of those items is also subject to import 10% tax. During this time, they also have a $10 discount for orders worth above `$500`.

Write a python program that prints out how much one would spend for both purchase and shipping of the given items from the given data that is stored in the lists provided.

Hints:
We can write two functions to provide a solution to this problem. 

* One function can iterate over the price list applying the respective tax and appending the result to the total_cost list.

* The other function can take the number of items in an order as its only parameter then return the cost of shipping the function's result. This function would only display the shipping charge.
